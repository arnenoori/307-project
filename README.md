## Project Blurb


Our project is a simple and smart app that makes it easy to keep track of your receipts and manage your money. Since the popular app Mint closed down, there's a gap in the market for a good financial tool. Our app fills this gap.

Here's what it does:

1. Scan Receipts Easily: Just scan your receipts with the app. It uses OpenAI's technology to read and store them quickly.
2. Stay On Budget: The app shows you where your money goes, helping you stick to your budget.
3. Ask Questions: Got questions about your spending? Ask the app's finance assistant for help.

In short, our app makes it easy to track your spending and get better at managing your money.
